NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::ElasticModel - Use Elastic::Model in your Dancer
    application

VERSION
    version 0.04

SYNOPSIS
        use Dancer::Plugin::ElasticModel;

        emodel->namespace('myapp')->index->create;

        edomain('myapp')->create( user => { name => 'Joe Bloggs' });

        my $results = eview('users)->search;

DESCRIPTION
    Easy access to your Elastic::Model-based application from within your
    Dancer apps.

CONFIG
        plugins:
            ElasticModel:
                model:          MyApp
                es:
                    servers:    es1.mydomain.com:9200
                    transport:  http
                views:
                    users:
                        domain: myapp
                        type:   user

    The "model" should be the name of your model class (which uses
    Elastic::Model). Any parameters specified in "es" will be passed
    directly to "new()" in ElasticSearch.

    Optionally, you can predefine named views, eg the "users" view above is
    the equivalent of:

        $view = $model->view( domain => 'myapp', type => 'user' );

METHODS
  emodel()
    "emodel()" gives you access to the model that you have configured in
    your "config.yml" file.

  edomain()
        $domain = edomain('mydomain');

    "edomain()" is a shortcut for:

        $domain = emodel->domain('mydomain');

  eview()
        $users = eview('users')->search:

    Access the "views" that you predefined in your "CONFIG".
