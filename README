NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::ElasticModel - Use Elastic::Model in your Dancer
    application

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
        use Dancer::Plugin::ElasticModel;

        emodel->domain('myapp')->create( user => { name => 'Joe Bloggs' });

        my $results = emodel->view->search;

DESCRIPTION
    Easy access to your Elastic::Model-based application from within your
    Dancer apps.

METHODS
  emodel()
    When you "use Dancer::Plugin::ElasticModel;" it will import a single
    method "emodel()" which gives you access to the model that you have
    configured in your "config.yml" file.

CONFIG
        plugins:
            ElasticModel:
                model:          MyApp
                es:
                    servers:    es1.mydomain.com:9200
                    transport:  http

    The "model" should be the name of your model class (which uses
    Elastic::Model). Any parameters specified in "es" will be passed
    directly to "new()" in ElasticSearch.
